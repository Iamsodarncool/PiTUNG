# PiTUNG

PiTUNG is a mod framework for the popular sandbox game [The Ultimate Nerd Game](https://iamsodarncool.itch.io/tung). It's not yet mature at all, but I think some cool mods can already be made with it.

You will need to decompile the game by yourself in order to replace the game's code. Unfortunately I can't provide any instructions on how to do this, but I will just say that there are a ton of good articles on the internet about decompiling Unity games.
