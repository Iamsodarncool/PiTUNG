Mod framework for The Ultimate Nerd Game

This is the build for the latest commit to the master branch, as such it's most likely unstable and you probably shouldn't use it: [download from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/pipe01/pitung/artifacts/bin%2FDebug%2FPiTung%20Bootstrap.dll)

## For users: How to install the framework

Installing the framework is extremely easy, just download [the installer](http://www.pipe0481.heliohost.org/pitung/Installer.exe) to the same folder as "The Ultimate Nerd Game.exe", and double-click it!

## For developers: How to create a mod

See [the wiki](../../wiki/Quickstart).

This framework uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) under the hood, so you may want to take a look at its documentation if you need more flexibility.
