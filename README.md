**WARNING**: This is the build for the latest commit to the master branch, as such it's probably unstable. Treat with care.

## For users: How to install the framework

Installing the framework is extremely easy, just download [the installer](http://www.pipe0481.heliohost.org/pitung/Installer.exe) to the same folder as "The Ultimate Nerd Game.exe", and double-click it!

## For developers: How to create a mod

See [the wiki](../../wiki/Quickstart).

This framework uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) under the hood, so you may want to take a look at its documentation if you need more flexibility.
